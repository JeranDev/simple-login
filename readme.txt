1. Define your project
	The goal of this project is to do a simple log-in page that uses HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and SQL.
	The audience will probably be just me, or maybe an employer if I really like it.
	
2. Plan out everything
	I plan to have 3 html pages, One with a simple login page, and the other with the JS lightshow I saw on StudioWeb, and a 	register for an account page, which will look like the login page.
	I want to be able to register an account, store that on a SQL database, then be able to log in.
	It will have a blog in the center of the index page, with LOG IN and REGISTER and two inputs for Username and Password 	
	The only navigation will be log in, register, and log out.
	
3. Sketch my Ideas
	I will create these 3 html pages in paint.
